<h1>Project Proposal</h1>
<br>
<hr>
<p><ul>
        <li>My website will be about introducing the food, culture, life style, scenic attractions and various special aspects of Chengdu.
        This website will provide the visitors with special tips when traveling in Chengdu as well as customizable recommendations about hotels, restaurants and shopping centers.
        </li>
        <li>After I came to US, I realized that not so many people knew about Chengdu. Most people showed interests when I mentioned that Chengdu was the hometown of pandas and hotpot, but they told me that when they searched Chengdu, there wasn't many contents to learn about.
        So I hope that I can let more people know about different sides of Chengdu and will be interested in traveling in Chengdu after having a deeper understanding of Chengdu's local culture. 
        </li>
        <li>My target audience will be anyone who has interets in learning about Chengdu or plans to travel in Chengdu. The style of the website will be colorful, eye-catching and dynamic.</li>
        <li>I plan to have eight pages in my website, including home page, contact/feedback page, sitemap, food page, local culture and life-style page, attractions page, traveling tips page and a page where visitors can find recommendations of hotels, restaurants and shopping guide based on their personal needs and there will be links that can lead them to other useful websites to book hotels, restaurants and rent cars, etc. </li>
</ul>
