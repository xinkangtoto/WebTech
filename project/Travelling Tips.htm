<h1>The Things You Must Know When Traveling in Chengdu</h1>
<p>China blocks many familiar and frequently-used websites and appssuch as Google, Facebook, Instagram and many others. If you rely on these applications to stay in touch, you will will find them not working when you try to access them in China. Work around this issue by getting a VPN before you go.
        A VPN is a virtual private network within the wider internet that allows users to send and receive data while maintaining the secrecy of a private network. 
        English is not commonly  spoken or understood — even by taxi drivers, hotel bellman and tour guides — in Chengdu. Of course there are exceptions but it is good to have a translator on your smartphone. Google Translate works if you have a VPN, but the free, basic Pleco app works better in China. Pleco is an all-in-one Chinese dictionary and document reading app that is available for use with iPhone, iPad, or iPods as well as Android devices.
        While free Wi-Fi is available in China, it can be difficult to accesswithout knowing Mandarin and having a local phone number. If you want to have readily available, inexpensive mobile Wi-Fi, get a Glocal Me my-fi device (works in many countries around the world) via Amazon.  
        Mobile payments by smartphone are used everywhere in Chengdu, but Apply Pay is not a frequently used platform. It would be highly recommended to download and set up the WeChat app before you travel to China.
