		<p id="instruction">
			This question has two parts: (a) Add appropriate functionality to the two buttons below such that when the first button is
			clicked, the Celtics image is shown and when the second is clicked,the Patriots image is shown (5 points if written as
			two separate functions, 10 if written as a single function). (b) When the mouse is moved over the image (note that only
			one image is shown at a time), add a red, ridge border that is 10px thick. When the mouse is removed, the border should
			disappear (10 points).
