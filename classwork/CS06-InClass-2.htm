<p>This is a paragraph.  I've tried to make it long enough to scroll onto a second line.  If it's still two short, please resize your window so that you can observe whether or not it's indented properly.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph.  Note that it has exactly the same style as the first paragraph.  You will need to learn how to use in-line styles or tag ids if you want this paragraph to be formatted differently from the one above.</p>
