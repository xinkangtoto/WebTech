                Do they just not worry about every little detail? I've never known a gorilla to read and study carefully 
                seventeen books on bringing up baby gorillas. And they seem to know just what to do. They never worry about 
                spoiling their little gorilla babies. They never worry about not having enough time with them. Now, don't get 
                me wrong, I'd rather be human than a gorilla any day. Just imagine having to sit in a zoo. (Did you figure out yet that 
                while gorillas were on my mind, I could only find a picture of an elephant?)

                It's hard to tell what goes through a baby elephant's mind when its mom is trying to put it to sleep. 
                Do you think baby elephants wake up in the middle of the night and cry? 
                Do their moms and dads take turns getting up with them to rock them back to sleep? 
                How do you rock an elephant, anyway?
                And what about gorillas?

                Today in the paper there's a story about a new gorilla that was just born in Franklin Park. 
                Its mom is holding on to it just like any proud human mom. 
                And I have to wonder if they go through as much trauma as that human mom when it comes to sleep, and food, 
                and diapers, and running into the street.

        An elephant family is ruled by a matriarch (older female), and generally consist of her female 
        offspring and their young. In Africa, a basic family unit consists of six to twelve animals, but 
        families of twelve to twenty elephants are quite common. An elephant family will split depending
        on the size of the family, the amount of available food, and how well they are getting along. 
        When the matriarch dies, one of the oldest offspring takes her place. An elephant family is led 
        by a matriarch, with the matriarch being the oldest and most experienced of the herd. The matriarchal 
        society consists of her female offspring and their young. In some cases it may include one of the 
        matriarch's sisters and her offspring as well. It is this close contact and relationship allows 
        the rest of the elephant to acquire knowledge to be used when needed.
